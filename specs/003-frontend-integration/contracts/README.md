# Frontend API Contracts

This directory does not contain new API contracts for the frontend. Instead, the frontend consumes the API contracts defined in the backend feature's contracts directory (`specs/002-chatbot-backend/contracts/`).

The frontend will adhere to the specifications defined in:
- `specs/002-chatbot-backend/contracts/chat.yml`
- `specs/002-chatbot-backend/contracts/translate.yml`

This ensures clear communication protocols between the frontend and backend services.
