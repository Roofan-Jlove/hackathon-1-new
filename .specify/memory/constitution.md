# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Using Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
Technical accuracy in all explanations of AI, software engineering, and deployment.

### Clarity and Accessibility
Clarity and accessibility for readers with beginner-to-intermediate knowledge of AI and web development.

### Consistency
Consistency of structure, writing style, and terminology across all chapters.

### Practicality
All tutorials, code samples, and workflows must be directly executable.

### Traceability
Claims about tools, frameworks, or technologies should reference official documentation or reputable sources.

## Key Standards

- Each chapter must follow consistent formatting: introduction → concepts → examples → exercises → references
- Code examples must be tested and syntactically valid
- All architectural diagrams, workflows, and examples must reflect real, modern development practices
- Citation style: link to official docs, RFCs, standards, academic papers, or trusted industry sources
- Minimum 30% of explanations must include hands-on examples or step-by-step instructions

## Constraints and Success Criteria

**Constraints:**
- Total manuscript length: ~20,000–30,000 words
- Book structure: 10–14 chapters + appendix
- Output format: Docusaurus-ready Markdown files
- Deployment output: GitHub Pages workflow YAML + final build-ready Docusaurus folder
- Copyright policy: 0% tolerance for plagiarism; all AI-generated content must be original or paraphrased with citations

**Success Criteria:**
- Book builds successfully using Docusaurus without errors
- GitHub Pages deployment completes successfully
- All examples and commands work as written
- Clear, cohesive narrative flow across all chapters
- Passes manual technical review for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
- Approved as a fully functional AI/spec-driven, automated book-generation project

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All contributions and reviews must verify compliance with these principles and standards.
